Hi,

I am Reinier and have spent most of my working life in the supply chain managementy/logistics and in various consulting roles.
In 2023 I completed a Data Science and Analytics bootcamp at Monash University (Australia) as I would like to combine my experience 
with these newly acquired skills.

Please contact me via email (reinierandrew@me.com) if you would like further information or if you would like to discusss any possible assigments.
